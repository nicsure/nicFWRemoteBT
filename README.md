This is the V1.0 release.

There's no docs as the App is intuitive enough not to need any. Everything is easy to navigate and understand.
Tested and working on Android and Windows. The Android APK is available in releases.

This app is designed to be a framework and/or reference for others to create a better solution. I will likely not be further developing it as such Issues are disabled, if there's a problem that needs fixing or you want extra features you'll need to fork and fix it yourself or wait for someone else to do it.
